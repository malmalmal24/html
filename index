    <h1>My Beautiful Beautiful Princess Putri,</h1>
    <p>
      Hey it's your sayang and I am writing a love letter again, I am glad that i decided to replied to princess bubblegum. It was the best and it is still the best choice I have ever made. honestly, I have never thought
      that you'll fall in love with me too. I still remember the day when i confessed to you. I still remember how fast my heart was pumping that day. I was so nervous to tell you that I am actually in love with you.
      When u said you love me too, I was stunned for a second and I asked myself, " how could this beautiful girl is in love with me, is she being real?" honestly I still can't 
      believe that you're the love of my life. I just honestly I don't feel like i deserve you but everyday literally everyday I am trying my best to be a better man for you. 
      Although it might be a slow progress but I am trying to be the man that deserve to be with someone like you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so happy that you're here in my life. I am falling deeper for you everyday honestly. You're the reason I got my laugh again. You're also the reason my I sleep 
      peacefully at night. You're also the reason why my life is getting better. You're literally my blue, my purple and my yellow ( you ask me what this means hehe ). You showed me the side of you that you never showed anyone else and honestly
      that side of you is beautiful. I cant deny that you're really is beautiful. you are literally an angel that fell from the heavens. You helped me overcome some of my traumas.
      Thank you, you really give me joy. I am really really in love with you. My heart is all yours from the beginning. I know sayang, I hurted you alot. I am sorry for hurting
      you but one thing i can promise you is that I'll make it up to you and remove all the scars that i gave intentionally or unintentionally. I'll remove it I promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why i fell for you. honestly there are millions of reasons that i could give on why you're the woman that i chose to fall in love with forever. There are no perfect
      words to describe the love that I have for you. It's honestly so big, bigger than the universe, bigger than our ass. you're the first woman that I have beg to stay.
      I dont regret begging you to stay because I promised you that I'll love you forever right? sayang if I could show you how big my love for you, I would, if I could take all
      the burdens and pain off your shoulders, I would put in on mine. I knew that I was badly inlove with you to the point that I want you forever was when i told myself that 
      "ah I really don't wanna lose her". This was when we just started our relationship. hehe I cried because I dont wanna lose you ever. I still remember our first fight too,
      It was kinda bad but u know we came back to each others and found a solution. I told you this so many times but your eyes, your eyes are really really mesmerrizing. I could
      stare in it forever honestly. I am really sorry that we hurt each others alot but my love for you have never fade away. you really really made me fall in love with you
      to the point that i would beg for you on my knees. I am really in love with you. Please dont feel bad for me anymore. Please just love me forever. I really wanna make
      you smile again. I love your smile, I love the way how you can be cute when u dont want me to be mad, I love how affectionate you are when you're in the mood, I love 
      the way you talk to me, I really missyou calling me your sayang, I miss your I love you. I really mean it when I said you're the woman of my dreams. I love you and
      you insecurities. Let me embrace you and your insecurities, let me call you my beautiful woman again, I literally would jump off the roof if that's what it takes for you to love me.
      I love all of you sayang. I really do.  
    </p>
    <p>
     I really do believe that you're my twin flame because everytime we had a problem, we'll always find a way to be with each others again. I wanna try again, I really do.
     I love you with all my life and soul. Leaving you is not in my to do list with you hehe. Deep down in my heart, I really want this forever Putri.
     I promised myself and you that I'll love you forever and I won't break this promise, ever. I hope the way that I love you is how you would love the be treated and loved,
     this is my first relationship and I really really hope I love you correctly. I have never showed this side of me to anyone else. Yes I can be annoying, jealous, obsessed,
     and posessive at times. I am sorry for showing you that side of me. Honestly, I hate that side of me too because i know for a fact that you might leave because of it one day.
     We've been through together alot. All those bad times we went through together will always be a lesson for me to change and be a better version of myself
     for you and all good times we spent timw together, I will forever cherish it and put it in my heart. I still remember your giggles, your voice and the way you're excited
     to tell me something that u love or u hate. I miss your voice, your face and all of you. I really wanna see you in real life, I wanna hold your hands and never let it go.
     These days, You keep coming into my dreams, did you miss me? orang tua-tua dulu cakap kalau dia rinduuuuuuu nanti dia keluar dalam mimpi kita hehe. Everynight u were in
     my prayers, every night i would pray to Allah that if you're good for me, make her for me. If you're bad for me, please put all the good things and 
     make her for me. That's what I always pray everynight. I'll stay with you my love. I love you my cinter, forever. <3
